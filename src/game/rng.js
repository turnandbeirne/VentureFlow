// Small random-number helpers used throughout the game engine.
// Centralized here so the "randomness surface" is easy to find.
//
// Backed by a seedable deterministic PRNG (mulberry32) rather than raw
// Math.random(). Every exported function keeps its original signature, so
// nothing elsewhere in the engine had to change to pick this up — normal
// play self-seeds from real entropy at module load (see below) and behaves
// exactly as before. seedRng() lets a caller reset the sequence to a known
// starting point, which is what makes the Daily Challenge mode (see
// game/dailyChallenge.js) work: every player who plays "today's challenge"
// gets the identical weather timeline, fortune-card draws, and price-drift
// noise, so differences in the final score come from player choices, not
// random luck.
//
// TWO independent streams, not one — this is the part that actually makes
// that fairness guarantee hold. The "environment" stream (weather duration,
// price drift noise, fortune-card draws — see weather.js/market.js/decks.js)
// is what every player's Daily Challenge run must share bit-for-bit. The
// default stream (business income rolls, robot decision-making, R&D
// payoffs, ...) is everything that stems from PLAYER CHOICES, which are
// allowed — expected — to differ. Once economy features let one player's
// choices affect another player's cash (Tree House rent depends on how
// much of it the WHOLE TABLE owns, not just one player — see players.js's
// effectiveRentPerUnit), a robot's cash trajectory can differ depending on
// what a human bought, which changes how many decision-rolls that robot's
// AI makes on its turn. If that consumed the SAME stream the environment
// draws from, two players' "identical" Daily Challenge environments would
// silently drift apart the moment their in-game choices diverged — exactly
// the bug a single shared stream can't avoid. Splitting the streams means a
// robot's own randomness can wobble around as much as it wants without ever
// touching the sequence weather/prices/cards are drawn from.
